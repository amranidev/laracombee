# Contribution Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!, this project follows some code standards and practices.

## Coding style.

Laracombee follows the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard.

### Doc blocks

Below is an example of a valid Laravel documentation block. Note that the @param attribute is followed by two spaces, the argument type, two more spaces, and finally the variable name:

```php
/**
 * Register a binding with the container.
 *
 * @param  string|array  $abstract
 * @param  \Closure|string|null  $concrete
 * @param  bool  $shared
 * @return void
 */
public function bind($abstract, $concrete = null, $shared = false)
{
    //
}
```

### Style CI

Don't worry if your code styling isn't perfect! [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) will automatically merge any style fixes into the Laravel repository after pull requests are merged. This allows us to focus on the content of the contribution and not the code style.
